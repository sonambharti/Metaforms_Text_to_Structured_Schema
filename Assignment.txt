AI Solution Design

Goal:


Design and prototype a system which converts unstructured plain text into structured format strictly following a desired JSON schema.



Assignment Scope:


You can expose the system via CLI or web app as per your convenience.

You can use any closed LLMâ€™s API, framework or libraries.

No constraints on cost or latency per request the solution takes. Do not optimize to save money or tokens.

No need for all the production grade bells and whistles like streaming, high throughputs, rate limit retries, etc.



What we will look for:


P1. A log of your decisions, experiments, insights around this problem.

P2. Solution that works on these sample test cases and outputs adhere to their schema.

P3. Can support large input context window tokens (50k text inputs, 100k schema files, 7+ nested schema, 1k+ literals)



Submission Guidelines:


Solution Design Doc, Implementation log,
A github repo and/or deployed UI and constraints you enforced
Trade offs you made and how you might address them given enough computation or time.
