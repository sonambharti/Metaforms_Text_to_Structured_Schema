Experience
Full Stack Developer (SDE-I) | Saarthi.ai , Bengaluru Aug 2023 – Apr 2025

• Led the BOT and NLU team to launch insurance renewal bot; solely developed and owned fraud detection bots
using scalable NLP pipelines, and SOLID - compliant production-grade code, accelerating delivery by 30%.

• Built generative AI bots using Gradio, LangChain, vectorDB (like weaviate), and prompt engineering to
implement RAG-based LLMs, reducing product lifecycle from 5 days to 1 day.

• Automated data preprocessing using Python scripts, reducing processing time by 40%, and trained CUX team in
dataset creation, which improved NLU and NER accuracy by 20% for BFSI clients.

• Implemented solutions to identify new entity through NER for 3 verticals, trained, fine-tuned and managing
production workloads on AWS cloud environment using Docker.

• Optimized voice/WhatsApp bots in Agile methodologies using asynchronous APIs, reducing latency by 30% and
annual infrastructure costs by up to 40%, while reviewing code to ensure best practices in accuracy, and efficiency.

• Conducted root cause analysis, and the mongoDB performance tuning, leveraging Grafana for monitoring to
improve service uptime and reduce support tickets by 50%, enhancing customer experience.

• Developed REST API, using CRUD functionality, and built microservice to enable robust ETL pipline between
client databases and our systems, ensuring seamless data integration and transformation.

• Containerized applications using Docker and orchestrated deployment via Kubernetes, enabling seamless rollouts
with CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions to reduce deployment delays by 20%.

• Collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline development workflows and, authored API and systems
documentation, and contributed to product architecture, improving team onboarding and codebase understanding.
